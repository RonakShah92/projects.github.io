Kaggle Competitions:
a)Author Identification.
b)Statoil/C-CORE Iceberg Classifier Challenge.
We have participated in the ’Spooky Author Identification’ challenge where we have to identify the author given a text from
one of the works of that particular author and the ’Statoil/C-CORE Iceberg Classifier Challenge’ where we
are given an image in the form of band signals and we need to create a model to identify it as a ’ship’ or an
’iceberg’. We have tried to use both, the conventional approaches like SVMs and Logistic Regression as well as
relatively new algorithms like Convoluted Neural Networks and Artificial Neural Networks in order to see how the
performance varies and understand the procedure of implementing these algorithms and also understand what
kind of preprocessing each of these approaches require.
